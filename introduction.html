<p>
I have been married for almost 2 years in June
<br>
I work at an online high school in Arizona
<br>
I served a mission in Mexico
<br>
I like web dev so far better than C++ programming";
<br>
I am currently obsessed with Roller Coaster Tycoon, again, since I played it as a kid.";
<br>
Now as I am older I see how well the game was programmed and how much time and effort Chris Sawyer (the creator) put into making it.
